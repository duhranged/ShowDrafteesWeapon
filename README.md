# ShowDrafteesWeapon
Shows a pawn's weapon icon on the colonist bar.

When a pawn has been drafted their equipped weapon icon will display under the pawn's avatar on the colonist banner. New mod settings have been added to allow weapons to be shown regardless of a pawn's drafted status and while they are traveling. The settings can be accessed via... Options > Mod Settings > Show Draftee's Weapon.

Settings:
- Show When Not Drafted - When checked weapons display regardless of the pawn's drafted status.
- Show When Traveling - When checked weapons display when pawns are traveling, and their drafted status meets the Show When Not Drafted setting.

Compatibility:
- Will work with existing saves
- Can be enabled/disabled without issue
- This mod should be compatible with mods that don't change the Colonist Bar. That said, if you run into issues try changing this mod's load position to be before/after other mods.
