    Shows a pawn's weapon icon on the colonist bar.

    When a pawn has been drafted their equipped weapon icon will display under the pawn's avatar on the colonist banner.

    Settings:
    (The settings can be accessed via... Options &gt; Mod Settings &gt; Show Draftee's Weapon)
    - Show When Not Drafted - When checked weapons display regardless of the pawn's drafted status.
    - Show When Traveling - When checked weapons display when pawns are traveling, and their drafted status meets the Show When Not Drafted setting.

    Compatibility:
    - Will work with existing saves
    - Can be enabled/disabled without issue
    - This mod should be compatible with mods that don't change the Colonist Bar. That said, if you run into issues try loading this mod before/after other Colonist Bar related mods.
